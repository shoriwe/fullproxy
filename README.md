         - create
         - user

# Concepts

## Master/Slave

Handles the proxying between a reverse connected (with encryption) proxy and the clients. In other words, it will
receive the connections of the clients and will forward the traffic to the proxy that is reverse connected to it.

### How it works

1. It first binds to the host specified by the user.
2. Then accept the connection from the proxy server.
3. Finally, it proxy the traffic of all new incoming connections to the proxy server that was reverse connected to it in
   the second step. In other words, is the proxy of another proxy but totally invisible for the client.

### Applications

This could be specially useful when you need to proxy a network that a machine have access to, but you can't bind with
it

## Translation

This protocol is simple, it receives proxying request in a specific proxying protocol to them forward them to another
proxy with another protocol; this means that if you only speaks SOCKS5, you will be able to talk to an HTTP proxy using
this "translator"

# Installation

## Pre-compiled binaries

You can find pre-compiled binaries for windows and linux [Here](https://github.com/shoriwe/FullProxy/releases)

## Build from source code

### Makefile

You can approach the `Makefile` that I prepare for the project, you just need to set the environment variables `CC`
and `CXX` and compiled based on:

```bash
make OS-ARCH-LINKING
```

For example:

- Compiling a static binary for a 64-bit based linux

```bash
make linux-64-static
```

- Compiling a dynamic binary for 32-bit based windows

```bash
make windows-32-dynamic
```

### Manual build

- Download the source code:

```shell
go get github.com/shoriwe/FullProxy
```

- Go to `cmd/FullProxy`

```shell
cd ~/go/src/github.com/shoriwe/FullProxy/cmd/FullProxy
```

- Compile it

```shell
# Statically
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w -linkmode external -extldflags=-static" -tags sqlite_omit_load_extension,netgo -mod vendor
# Or Dynamically
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" -mod vendor
```

### Note

In some systems it will be better to dynamically compile the binary instead of statically and in others, the other way,
this probably happens because in how each manage it's networking features and/or the dependencies of the sqlite3 library
